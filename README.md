# Resources for “*Collages and Patterns: Making art in R”*

## About

This repository contains supplemental resources and materials that
coincide with the [*Collages and Patterns Rtistry
talk*](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-philly/events/288397735/)
presented on Wednesday, October 12th for the [R-Ladies
Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/) Meetup Group. This presentation
aims to discuss the concept of creating generative art in R (Rtistry)
but then focus on a concept that seems to allude most: how to create the
data required for generative art.
