# Resources for "*Collages and Patterns: Making art in R"*

## About

This repository contains supplemental resources and materials that coincide with the [*Collages and Patterns Rtistry talk*](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-philly/events/288397735/) presented on Wednesday, October 12th for the [R-Ladies Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/) Meetup Group. This presentation aims to discuss the concept of creating generative art in R (Rtistry) but then focus on a concept that seems to allude most: how to create the data required for generative art.

## Presentation and Slides

The slides for this workshop can be viewed [here](https://meghansaha.github.io/collages_and_patterns/).

The recorded presentation for this workshop can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc7VaKRcrcY)

## Live Coding Example

Any pieces made during a live code at the end of the presentation will be linked and placed here when annotated and ready.
